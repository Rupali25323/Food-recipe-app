In this project first i created three components.first page is mainpage,in that i created searchbar and button.We can search any recipe by using API.and when we click to button it will go to the next page which is mealinformation component.In the second component all the images will come related to that perticular meal which we search before.After clicking the button it will show information about that meal.Here i used react router dom for routing purpose.The purpose of food recipe app is to provide users with a collection of recipies that help them prepare meals.
